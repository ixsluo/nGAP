# Gaussian Approximation Potentials(GAP)
Gaussian approximation potentials is an effective machine learning potentials(MLP) to calculate the properties of multi-species crystal under high pressure.

For more information of GAP, please read the paper  
[GaussianApproximation Potentials: The Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics, without the Electrons](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.136403)

## Using GAP

Thie project begin at 2019.07.08 for an effect frame to construct gaussian approximation potentials (GAP)
In this schame, there are three parts, 2-body many-body and electrostatic energy.
